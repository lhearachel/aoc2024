# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 in pure C.

Solutions must adhere to the following rules:

- No dependencies allowed. ðŸ™‚
- No modifications to code allowed between test input and full input. This
includes pre-processor directives.
- Compatible with the ANSI C99 standard. This is controlled with `-Wpedantic`
and `-std=c99`.
