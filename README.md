# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 in standard Python. No external
dependencies are allowed; if it's not in the standard library, then I must
implement it!

All solutions are standalone executable scripts which read their input from
`stdin`. To run a given solution, e.g. `day_01.py`:

```bash
python day_01.py < input_file
```
